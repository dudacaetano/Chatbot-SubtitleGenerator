# 📊Chatbot-SubtitleGenerator
Hey everyone! I've been working and studying more about NLP, and to delve deeper into the subject, I decided to develop a chatbot that helps you create captions for your photos based on Taylor Swift songs. The main idea is to upload a photo, and the chat will analyze which caption matches the aesthetic of your photo.
